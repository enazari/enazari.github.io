            <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
<p>This project aims to explore how different factors in imbalanced datasets affect the performance of GAN-based upsampling techniques in both imagery and cybersecurity domains. We investigate the impact of factors like class imbalance, sample size, data dimensionality, and class overlap when using a CGAN architecture for data augmentation in imagery data tests. We conduct experiments using the MNIST image dataset, generating multiple versions with varying difficulty factors for controlled observation. For cybersecurity data, we focus on the influence of class imbalance and sample size. The code for this project is publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/enazari/GAN-upsampling" style=" text-decoration: underline;" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To evaluate the upsampling framework, we use a 5-fold cross-validation process with two settings: the baseline setting and the CGAN-based augmentative setting. We test the CGAN-based framework on MNIST imagery datasets and non-imagery cybersecurity datasets. Additionally, we create different versions of these datasets with varying characteristics for analysis.</p>

<p>The CGAN-based augmentative up-sampling strategy involves training a CGAN on the original imbalanced training set, incorporating both minority and majority class cases. The trained generator generates synthetic data for the minority class, which is merged with the original training set to create a balanced training set.</p>

<p>Performance assessment metrics, particularly the f1-score for imbalanced datasets, are computed for each setting. For a more detailed understanding, refer to the figures depicting the baseline framework and the CGAN-based up-sampling architecture.</p>

<h3>Experiments with imagery datasets</h3>

<p>In our experiments, we utilized the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of hand-written digits with a size of 28 pixels by 28 pixels. Our goal was to create multiple datasets with varying attributes like sample size, class overlap, imbalance ratio, and number of features. To achieve this, we followed a specific procedure.</p>

<p>To form the datasets, we selected instances of the digit ‘four’ as the majority class cases from the MNIST dataset. We chose different sample sizes (1000, 400, 200, and 100) for the majority class while maintaining the original order of the instances. We then introduced three degrees of rotation (30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees) to generate the minority class instances. These rotations created different levels of class overlap, making it more challenging for a classifier to distinguish between them.</p>

<p>Additionally, we generated datasets with varying imbalance ratios (0.4, 0.2, and 0.1) for the minority class, and we resized the original images to smaller dimensions (14x14, 8x8, and 4x4 pixels) to create datasets with different numbers of features (784, 196, 64, and 16). These manipulations allowed us to study the relationship between imbalance ratio, feature count, and the effectiveness of the CGAN in addressing the imbalance issue.</p>

<p>By following this procedure, we were able to create diverse datasets with different attributes to explore their impact on the performance of our models.</p>

<h3>Overall Results with Imagery datasets</h3>

<p>In our analysis, we compared the average F1-score results from 144 tests before and after applying CGAN data augmentation. We measured the F1-score for both the majority class and the minority class.</p>

<p>Before augmentation, the majority class had an F1-score of 0.940310, which slightly decreased to 0.912214 after augmentation. In contrast, the minority class showed a significant improvement in the F1-score, increasing from 0.434325 without augmentation to 0.701059 with augmentation.</p>

<p>Overall, the results indicate that CGAN data augmentation has a positive impact on improving the F1-score for the minority class. However, there is a slight decrease in the F1-score for the majority class after augmentation. The aggregated F1-scores show a 3% decrease for the majority class and a notable 26% increase for the minority class. These findings suggest that employing CGAN-based augmentative upsampling is beneficial for datasets with multiple data difficulty factors, especially for improving the performance of the minority class.</p>

<p>During our project, we faced a challenge related to tabular non-imagery datasets, specifically in the context of cybersecurity datasets. Unlike imagery datasets where visual assessment of the CGAN generator’s outputs is possible, it is not feasible in cybersecurity due to the nature of the data. In imagery datasets, we can observe the generated images during training to evaluate their realism and diversity. However, in cybersecurity, visual assessment is not applicable. To overcome this challenge, we conducted empirical trials and settled on a fixed training duration of 1500 iterations. This challenge served as the basis for our subsequent project, called AutoGAN. In the <a href="/projects/autoGAN" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">AutoGAN Project</a>, we will introduce a method that effectively addresses this issue by providing an efficient and convenient approach to training a GAN on both imagery and tabular data.</p>

<h3>The Published Results</h3>
<p>The result shown above is the outcome we selected from experiments conducted on imagery datasets. We didn’t stop there! We also conducted a lot of experiments on Cybersecurity datasets, which are in a tabular format. We were excited to share our findings, so we published the results in two separate papers:</p>

            <p>Predictive modelling in cybersecurity domains usually involves dealing with complex settings. The class imbalance problem is a well-know challenge typically present in the cybersecurity domain. For instance, in a real-world intrusion detection scenario, the number of attacks is expected to be a a very small percentage of the normal cases. Moreover, in these applications, the number of available examples labelled is also small due to the complexity and cost of the labelling process: teams of domain experts need to be involved in the process which becomes expensive, time consuming and prone to errors. To address these problems is critical to the success of predictive modelling in cybersecurity applications.

  In this paper we tackle the class imbalance and small sample size through the use of a CGAN-based up-sampling procedure. We carry out an extensive set of experiments that show the positive impact of applying this solution to address the class imbalance and small sample size problems. A large data repository is built and freely provided to the research community containing 114 binary datasets based on real-world cybersecurity problems that are generated with diversified levels of imbalance and sample size. Our experiments show a clear advantage of using the CGAN-based up-sampling method specially for situations where the sample size is small and there is a large imbalance between the problem classes. In the most critical scenarios associated with extreme rarity and very small sample size, an impressive performance boost is achieved. We also explore the behaviour of this approach when the presence of these problems is less marked and we found that, while CGAN-based up-sampling is not able to further improve the minority class performance, it also has no negative impact. Thus, it is a safe to use solution, also in these scenarios. </p>

            <p>Over the last two decades, several approaches have been proposed to tackle the class imbalance problem which is characterized by the inability of a learner to focus on a relevant but scarcely represented class. The generation of synthetic examples to oversample the training set and thus force the learner to focus on the important cases is one of such solutions. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) started to be explored as an oversampling alternative due to their capability of generating samples from an implicit distribution. Still, data difficulty factors such as class overlap, data dimensionality or sample size, and were shown to also negatively impact the learners performance under an imbalance setting. The ability of GANs to deal with the imbalance problem and other data difficulty factors has not yet been assessed. The main goal of this paper is to understand how data difficulty factors impact the performance of GANs when they are used as an oversampling method. Namely, we study the performance of conditioned GANs (CGANs) in an image dataset with controlled levels of the following data difficulty factors: sample size, data dimensionality, class overlap and imbalance ratio. We show that CGANs are effective for tackling tasks with multiple data difficulty factors, exhibiting increased gains on the most difficult tasks.</p>
