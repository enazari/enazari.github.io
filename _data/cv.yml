      description:
        - Built a system to bypass face verification systems
          - Improved the current state-of-the-art approach's success rate by 16\% - from 43\% to 58\%
        - Created a system for training a GAN without requiring human oversight
          - Efficiently solved ``Is the GAN sufficiently trained?" using a novel algorithm tested on imagery and tabular data
        - Employed GANs to tackle the class imbalance problem the results of which are published in two papers
