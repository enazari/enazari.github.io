Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Ottawa at Cyber Range Lab [Graduating in August 2023]. 


During my time pursuing a Master's degree, I have had the privilege of working as a research assistant under Professors [Branco](https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/members/4218) and [Jourdan](https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/?lang=en#!/members/203). I enthusiastically have been engaged in multiple Deep Learning projects during this period, with two of them being documented in <a href="{{ '/publications' | relative_url }}" style=" text-decoration: underline;">three papers</a>.


I invite you to explore a collection of intriguing projects I have been persuing during my Master's, with a special emphasis on the captivating <strong>Unlocking Facial Recognition Systems with Master-Key Images</strong> project at <a href="{{ '/projects' | relative_url }}" style=" text-decoration: underline;">Projects</a>.



I am particularly interested in the field of <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, with a focus on<strong> Computer Vision</strong> applications. I am actively seeking opportunities as a <strong>Machine Learning Researcher/Engineer</strong>.
